gbhed:

version .18:
	2018-05-27
	* Tidy up, no functional changes.

version .17:
	2006-05-15
	* Added desktop entry
	* Less gui verboseness
	* Removed unnecessary and unused text overflow warning box
	* Migrated all gbhed functions to static
	* Fixed phonetic translation problem in GUI

version .16:
	2005-06-12
	* Improved configure script
	* Directly fork(), pipe(), and exec() translation subprocess,
	  instead of using popen(), which caused side effects. popen() forks
	  and invokes the shell, then runs the command, which resulted
	  in some undesired side effects (and is insignificantly less
	  effecient)
	* Escape characters no longer required for quotes and shell operators
	* New line characters now behave as expected
	* Removed arbitrary limit on buffer size
	* Rounded icons

version .15:
	2005-02-17
	* compilation of gbhed can now be disabled by
	  passing --disable-gbhed to configure
	* minor cleanup

version .14:
	2004-08-02
	* user alert when attempting to translate too much text
	* minor cleanup
	* man page should now show correct location of files

version .13:
	2004-05-07
	* text buffer increased to a thousand characters
	* todo: alert user when buffer limit has been reached to avoid
	* truncation or possible crash

version .12:
	* fixed bug that caused an error to occure when translating an
	  apostrophe
	* some general code cleanup

version .11:
	2004-4-24

	* added man pages

abtranslate:

version .09:
	2018-05-27
	* Improved performance.

version .08:
	2006-06-12
	* Better character support
	* Improved configure script

version .07:
	2005-02-17
	* Large rewrite.  Important changes to note:
	* Now written in C
	* Dynamic handling of text removes arbitrary limit
	  on amount of text that can be translated
	* Reads from standard input if no text is provided upon
	  the command line.  This also allows for input redirection
	  and piping (ex: abtranslate -e < text_file or
	  cat text_file | abtranslate -e)
	* Improved command line options
	* Compilation of abtranlated can now be disabled by passing
	  --disable-abtranslate to configure
