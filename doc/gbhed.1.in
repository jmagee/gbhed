.SH NAME
gBhed \- GTK+ Al Bhed translator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gbhed
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gBhed 
is a GUI frotend for abtranslate, an Al Bhed translator.  It is written using GTK+.  Al Bhed is a cipher from the game Final Fantasy X and is usually referred to as a language.  gBhed can translate from English to Al Bhed, from Al Bhed to English, and from Al Bhed to phonetics.  The phonetics could be useful for those involved in cosplay, although there is a great deal of debate on exactly how to speak Al Bhed.  Generally proper nouns are not translated.  Putting a word in brackets [ ] will prevent the contents from being translated.
